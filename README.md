# fetch-receipt-processor-challenge

This repository contains my solution for the **Receipt Processor Challenge** â€“ a take-home exercise for a Backend Engineer opportunity at Fetch. The goal of the challenge is to build a documented API that processes receipt data, calculates reward points based on a set of business rules, and exposes endpoints to both process receipts and retrieve their computed scores.

For more details on the challenge, please refer to the [Fetch Rewards Receipt Processor Challenge repository](https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge/tree/main).
